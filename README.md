# Shuriken

Uses a ray-cast intersection from the mouse to the ground plane to shoot projectiles. <br />
Basic follow AI with animated flipping textures based on relative position to player. <br />
The main purpose of this is to demonstrate the concept of properly controlling 2-D aiming and movement in a 3-D environment. <br />
This idea was inspired by the game Realm of the Mad God, and similar concepts are used in Enter the Gungeon. <br />
In essence, I'm casting a ray from the player viewpoint and drawing a flat line from the character to determine the aim point. <br />
